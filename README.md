Jesse Millar's little brother wanted a little utility that would return the 
first letter of every word in a paragraph, so he created this tool to do just that.

I expanded on it a little bit to also display a mnemonic device for the letters 
returned, using a [list of the 10,000 most common english words]
(https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english).
